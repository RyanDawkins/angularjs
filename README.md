# angular.js presentation 

This is my presentation for angular.js to explain the basics around it. 

## Topics I'll cover:
* Folder Structure
* First module
* View
* Built in directives (ng-*)
* Controllers and binding to the view
* Services/factories
* More on $scope and $rootScope
* $window, $location, $document
* Custom directives

## Prerequisites
It is expected that you know JavaScript before you dive into angular because it is a JavaScript framework.
